# ⚠️  OpenAI Client Compatibility Issue - RESOLVED

## What Happened?

You encountered this error:
```
Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

This happened because:
1. You had OpenAI v1.95.1 installed
2. The setup script downgraded to v1.54.0
3. The downgrade caused compatibility issues with httpx

## ✅ Quick Fix (Run This)

```bash
bash fix_openai_client.sh
```

This will:
- Clean uninstall openai, httpx, httpcore
- Reinstall latest compatible versions
- Test the installation

## 🔧 Manual Fix (If Quick Fix Doesn't Work)

### Option 1: Use Latest OpenAI Version
```bash
pip3 uninstall openai -y
pip3 install --upgrade openai
```

### Option 2: Clean Reinstall
```bash
pip3 uninstall openai httpx httpcore -y
pip3 install openai
```

### Option 3: Use Specific Compatible Versions
```bash
pip3 install "openai>=1.0.0" "httpx>=0.24.0"
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

After fixing, run:
```bash
python3 test_openai_client.py
```

Or:
```bash
python3 test_shivaay_integration.py
```

## 💻 Working Code Example

Once fixed, this should work:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("SHIVAAY_API_KEY", "your-key"),
    base_url="https://api.futurixai.com/api/shivaay/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="shivaay",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 📋 Checklist

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Run: `bash fix_openai_client.sh`
- [ ] Verify: `python3 test_openai_client.py`
- [ ] Set API key: `export SHIVAAY_API_KEY="your-key"`
- [ ] Test integration: `python3 test_shivaay_integration.py`
- [ ] Run demos: `python3 examples/shivaay_demo.py`

- **Troubleshooting Guide:** `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- **Debug Script:** `python3 debug_client.py`
- **Integration Guide:** `docs/SHIVAAY_INTEGRATION.md`

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The original requirement was `openai==1.54.0` (specific version), but you already had a newer version (1.95.1) installed. Downgrading caused compatibility issues.

**Solution:** Use flexible version requirement: `openai>=1.0.0` (allows latest)

## ✨ After Fix

Once fixed, you can use all the integration features:

```bash
# Set API key
export SHIVAAY_API_KEY="your-actual-key"

# Run demos
python3 examples/shivaay_demo.py

# Test with image
python3 examples/shivaay_demo.py test_files/test_invoice.png

# Use in your code
from src.services.ocr_service import perform_ocr_with_shivaay
```

---

**TL;DR:** Run `bash fix_openai_client.sh` to fix the issue automatically!
